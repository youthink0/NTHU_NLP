    "Now, having the concepts of skip-gram and MapReduce in mind, it's time to put these all together: let's generate skip-gram table with MapReduce technique!  \n",
    "\n",
    "It may sound scary to some of you, so let's break it down first.  \n",

    "   a c 1  1\n",
    "   a b -3 1\n",
    "   b d 2  1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **Shuffler**: Group all skipgrams by its text. This can be easily achieved with sorting.  \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   a b -3 1\n",
    "   a b -3 1\n",

    "   a c 3  1\n",
    "   b d 2  1\n",
    "   c e -2 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **Reducer** :  \n",
    "   Since the results have been sorted in the previous step, we can easily calculate the frequency of each skip-gram with different distance.  \n",
